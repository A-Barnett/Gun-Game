# Gun Game
This is one of the larger games I created while learning Unity. 
It is a gun-game in an infinite procedural world, with basic state machine enemies and a practice range.

## Assets
The weapon models are from Simon Mercuzot - [Low Poly Weapons](https://assetstore-fallback.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/low-poly-weapons-vol-1-151980), I made all of the animations for these in Blender.
The procedural generation largely based upon a tutorial series called [Procedural Terrain Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8) by Sebastian Lague.
